# WeatherApp 🌩
<h4>A react native project, a weather app inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2W9MPjrIbk">tutorial</a> from the youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DesignCodeTeam">DesignCode</a>.</h4>
<h4> The tutorial it's in SwiftUI 🍎, so I tried to recreate it with React Native ⚛</h4>
